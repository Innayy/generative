Look at the poster. Do you agree that staying home during the COVID-19 outbreak promotes family bonding?,"Yes, I definitely believe so. During the time when we had to stay at home as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we had a lot more opportunities to bond as a family. 

My family and I enjoy playing board games, watching movies and most recently, even exercising together! Never in my life had I spent so much time with my family. 

During the circuit breaker, we were cooped up at home. Thus, my parents, my younger brother and I decided to make the most out of it. We made our usual stay-home activities more fund and engaging. For instance, we turned out favourite board game, Cluedo, into a real-life hide-and-seek game, which we played in the comfort of our home. We pretended to be characters from the board game and left clues that would reveal our hiding spots to one another. This resulted in many hours of joy and laughter. 

Spending such precious moments with my family at home for a prolonged period has certainly been a gratifying experience.","Yes, I definitely believe so. During COVID, many of us could not go anywhere but stay at home. 

My dad used to travel a lot. Due to COVID, he did a lot of his work from home through online meetings. 

For example, before COVID, we only usually have meals together during the weekends. Pre-COVID, if my Dad did not travel, he would have meetings. But during COVID, my Dad had dinner with us during weekdays. He even helped me with my homework.

Do family bonding activities bring family members closer together? Why do you say so?,"Engaging in such activities enable families to spend quality time together. Through this, they can communicate openly to one another and share their thoughts and feelings uninhibitedly.

Do you think parents spend enough time with their children nowadays? Why or why not? ,"Due to busy lifestyle and hectic schedules, parents do not get to spend as much time as they would like to with their children. 

In a fast-paced society such as Singapore, parents spend long hours working in order to provide for their families. This prevents them from giving their children some much-needed time and attention. Some parents from lower-income families juggle multiple jobs to make ends meet. For children in such households, being able to see their parents becomes a rare occasion. In order to manage their problem, parents and children can work together to set some time aside, every day, to check in on each other. 

Though both my parents work, they make it a point to ensure that we have dinner together as a family no matter how busy we are. During this time, we steer clear of our phones and other distractions, so that we can catch up on how each of our days was. It is, therefore, pertinent to recongnise that this is a problem in most families and try to find solutions to overcome it. 

To summarise, though all parents ideally want to spend more time with their children, the reality of today’s hectic world makes this difficult.

What would you consider when choosing a school?,"There are many factors to consider when choosing a school. 

Firstly, the distance from my home plays a large
role in determining whether I should attend a school. A large amount of time will be spent in school due to classes and co-curricular activities (CCAs). I predict that I would be very tired after my CCAs, and it would be important for home to be close by to minimise travelling time.

Another factor to consider is the types of CCAs available. I enjoy taking part in the performing arts, and wish to join a CCA that allows me to perform. Therefore, I am hoping to join a school that has several
performing arts CCAs for me to choose from. 

I would also consider the school's reputation and standing. Schools with a good reputation will usually produce better students. Lastly, I would like to join a school where my friends attend too. I think that I would find school a lot more interesting if my friends were
with me. 

When choosing a school, I think that I would seek advice from my parents and my teachers. My parents would understand me the best, and they would
look out for my best interests. My teachers would know my academic strengths and weaknesses, so they would know which school suits me. Furthermore, they
would be more familiar with what each school offers and will be better-placed to offer their opinions about which school environment is most suitable for me.

Since we would be spending a lot of time together in class, this would give us plenty of opportunities to get to know each other. I believe that regular interaction and shared experiences would help us to form a bond. In addition, I would also try to make friends through my Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), which is badminton. As we would have regular training sessions together, this would provide us with a common interest and shared experiences, making it easier for us to become friends. I am confident that these strategies would help me to make friends quickly in a new school.')]}",True
