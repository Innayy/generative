Look at the poster. Do you agree that staying home during the COVID-19 outbreak promotes family bonding?,"Yes, I definitely believe so. During the time when we had to stay at home as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we had a lot more opportunities to bond as a family. 

My family and I enjoy playing board games, watching movies and most recently, even exercising together! Never in my life had I spent so much time with my family. 

During the circuit breaker, we were cooped up at home. Thus, my parents, my younger brother and I decided to make the most out of it. We made our usual stay-home activities more fund and engaging. For instance, we turned out favourite board game, Cluedo, into a real-life hide-and-seek game, which we played in the comfort of our home. We pretended to be characters from the board game and left clues that would reveal our hiding spots to one another. This resulted in many hours of joy and laughter. 

Spending such precious moments with my family at home for a prolonged period has certainly been a gratifying experience.","Yes, I definitely believe so. During COVID, many of us could not go anywhere but stay at home. 

My dad used to travel a lot. Due to COVID, he did a lot of his work from home through online meetings. 

For example, before COVID, we only usually have meals together during the weekends. Pre-COVID, if my Dad did not travel, he would have meetings. But during COVID, my Dad had dinner with us during weekdays. He even helped me with my homework. "

Spending such precious moments with my family at home for a prolonged period has certainly been a gratifying experience.","I am not sure if it creates family bonding. My dad is a doctor and he got even busier during COVID. My mother is a housewife and hence, she has already been dedicating a lot of time for the family. Hence, I guess it promotes family bonding as I heard my friend saying they see their parents more. But I did not feel so in particular. But I am very proud of my dad’s contribution to the society during this critical period. "
Do family bonding activities bring family members closer together? Why do you say so?,"Engaging in such activities enable families to spend quality time together. Through this, they can communicate openly to one another and share their thoughts and feelings uninhibitedly. This in turn, fosters a sense of togetherness and makes family members feel more emotionally connected. Moreover, they can even uncover interesting nuggets of information about one another that they were previously unaware of.  

This was especially true in my case. During the circuit breaker period, I discovered that my mother was an animal lover who used to rescue abandoned animals and my father had a black belt in taekwondo! 

All in all, I believe that sharing such fascinating stories while bonding together as a family has deepened our understanding and appreciation of one another. ",My family like going to the zoo. We really enjoy spending time there. My dad is a vet and they would also tell my brother and I more knowledge about animals.

My grandmother said she taught my mom and how she is teaching me. Whenever we make cakes together, my grandmother would tell us stories of about my mother and my uncles when they were young. My brother and I really enjoy listening to the stories.  "
Do you think parents spend enough time with their children nowadays? Why or why not? ,"Due to busy lifestyle and hectic schedules, parents do not get to spend as much time as they would like to with their children. 

In a fast-paced society such as Singapore, parents spend long hours working in order to provide for their families. This prevents them from giving their children some much-needed time and attention. Some parents from lower-income families juggle multiple jobs to make ends meet. For children in such households, being able to see their parents becomes a rare occasion. In order to manage their problem, parents and children can work together to set some time aside, every day, to check in on each other. 

Though both my parents work, they make it a point to ensure that we have dinner together as a family no matter how busy we are. During this time, we steer clear of our phones and other distractions, so that we can catch up on how each of our days was. It is, therefore, pertinent to recongnise that this is a problem in most families and try to find solutions to overcome it. 

To summarise, though all parents ideally want to spend more time with their children, the reality of today’s hectic world makes this difficult. 
",I don’t think parents spend enough time with their children. My parents are always busy with their work. My friends also say their parents are very busy. So many of the children end up spending time with their helpers.

Look at the poster. Does this banner make you want to join this school? Why / Why not?  ,"Yes, this banner definitely makes me want to join this school. This banner shows that the school focuses on a holistic education for pupils. Often, schools have
a narrow scope of success for its pupils.

Success for pupils is usually only limited to academics, and achievements in other fields such as the arts or athletics are often ignored. However, the banner for
this school is clearly different as it shows that pupils are able to broaden their horizons beyond academics and develop themselves to become well-rounded individuals. 

As someone interested in music and sports, I would have liked to be able to pursue my interests. However, they had to take a backseat to my studies.
Seeing this banner makes me believe that this school would place equal emphasis on all aspects of education, thus making me want to join this school. ","Yes, the banner makes me want to join the school as it portrays a happy vibe. 

It seems that students get to develop their talents while enjoying school very much.  "

What would you consider when choosing a school?,"There are many factors to consider when choosing a school. 

Firstly, the distance from my home plays a large
role in determining whether I should attend a school. A large amount of time will be spent in school due to classes and co-curricular activities (CCAs). I predict that I would be very tired after my CCAs, and it would be important for home to be close by to minimise travelling time.

Another factor to consider is the types of CCAs available. I enjoy taking part in the performing arts, and wish to join a CCA that allows me to perform. Therefore, I am hoping to join a school that has several
performing arts CCAs for me to choose from. 

I would also consider the school's reputation and standing. Schools with a good reputation will usually produce better students. Lastly, I would like to join a school where my friends attend too. I think that I would find school a lot more interesting if my friends were
with me. 

When choosing a school, I think that I would seek advice from my parents and my teachers. My parents would understand me the best, and they would
look out for my best interests. My teachers would know my academic strengths and weaknesses, so they would know which school suits me. Furthermore, they
would be more familiar with what each school offers and will be better-placed to offer their opinions about which school environment is most suitable for me.
","I wish to go to a good school. First, this will make my parents feel very proud of me. I think there are many good CCAs in good school too. "
How would you try to make friends in a new school?,"I would first try to make friends with my classmates. Since I would be seeing them every day, making friends with them would be my first option. I hope that by
seeing them every day and interacting
with them, we can become fast friends.

Alternatively, another way to make friends is through my CCA. Seeing that we joined the same CCA, it would mean that we have a common interest. This would provide a talking point to allow us to become friends. Hopefully, these will help me make friends in a new school quickly. ","I believe I will make friends in my class and CCA. My CCA is badminton which requires regular training. Hence, I would see my teammates regularly and it would help us to get to know each other easily. "
